# Geo-AI Drainage Systems - Round 2 Pitch

## Executive Summary

We present an AI-powered intelligent drainage system design solution that leverages deep learning and geospatial analysis to automatically design resilient drainage networks for rural Indian villages using drone imagery and 3D point cloud data.

### The Challenge
- Rural villages in India face critical infrastructure gaps with inadequate drainage systems
- Manual drainage design is time-consuming, expensive, and requires specialized expertise
- Poor drainage causes waterlogging, crop damage, health hazards, and economic losses
- Affects millions of rural households across India
